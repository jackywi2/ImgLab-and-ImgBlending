# GUI for ImgLab and ImgBlending
$\large{\textbf{Overview}}$

This graphical user interface (GUI) is developed in the Python environment for YOLO data formatting. Its features include object annotation within images and image blending using background-removed object images. The final output can be saved as images along with YOLO-format labels. Additionally, we provide labels for object bounding boxes to facilitate data augmentation or conversion into formats compatible with other image recognition models. When processing the next image, users simply need to open a new image to annotate or blend it.

# Environment Setup
